# Programming is a contract

Programming is based on an agreement between two programmers : the user and the doer

How does this contact take place in python ?

The answer is : through functions !

So what is a function ?

See it as in math, a function f(x) is a way to transformes inputs into outputs.

For example : f(x) = 2x + 1

In python you write it like this :

```
# def (or define) with the function name.
def f(x) :
  #Then the body will be actual logic or math that takes place
  y = 2x + 1
  #Then you return the answer as if you were saying : answer is y
  return y
  # alternativelly you can say answer is  y = 2x + 1
  return y = 2x + 1

# From then on, you can use your function to solve the equation :
print(f(5))
# Will print 11 
```
This is one way of seeing it

It is the contract you sign 
that says : if you give me any input I will give you your desired output in this case 2x + 1

From then on, you can imagine all sorts of contract functions !

Try and imagine the staire function : How would you do it ?
