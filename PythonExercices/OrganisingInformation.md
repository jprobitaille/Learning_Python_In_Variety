# Programming is the art of organising information

Coding is the art of finding clear and comprehensible path to a solution

For that, you need to be organised.

If I tell you that my function always adds two numbers, and you wrote a functions that only adds 1 to a number, we have a problem.

Scale this on 10 000 lines of code and we've got a big problem.

So to be organised, a few tools and tips existe.

First always write a clear definition of your function : If it does a square root, call it square_root

then you can juste stack you functions like crazy :

```
y = square_root(x) + 3
```

OR

```
y = add_three(square_root(x))
```

Because why not...
And it remains somewhat clear.


A second useful trick is to use classes.

This is a way to regroup either functions that go together.

For example : a Math class does addition, substraction, multiplacation, etc.

Or Caracteristics :

For example : A Person class has the caracteristic of that person's age for example.

Or Both ! Obviously

Theses are the 2 basic tools

With practice, you learn to notice, what is clear to you, to others, and most importantly : what is not clear to you (or others).
