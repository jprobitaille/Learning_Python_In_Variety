# Ideas and principles that can inspire activities

## Reach out to what they know

Whether it's minecraft or make-up, gender issues or litterature, try and reach out to what they themselves already know !

## Use the element of surprise

When you are surprised, you are suddenly aware and focused, you thought you knew something and then not. \
This can be used to directe focus to something new.

## The human machine

Act like a machine to show that, to a machine, things are not that "obvious".
